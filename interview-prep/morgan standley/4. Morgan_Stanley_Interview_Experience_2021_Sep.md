## Online Assessment (OA)

The OA was conducted on the **Aspiring Minds (SHL) platform** with three sections: MCQs (Aptitude, OS, Networks), Debugging (7 questions), and Coding (3 questions). You could revisit questions within a section but not switch between sections.

### Section 1: MCQs (Aptitude, OS, Computer Networks)

**Problem Statement**:  
- Questions on Quantitative Aptitude, Operating Systems, and Computer Networks.
- Topics:  
  - **Aptitude**: Permutations, probability, time-and-work, data interpretation.  
  - **OS**: Process scheduling, memory management, threads, deadlocks.  
  - **Networks**: OSI model, TCP/IP, routing protocols, subnetting.
- Difficulty: Easy to medium, testing conceptual understanding.

**Approach**:  
- **Preparation**:  
  - Aptitude: Practice quants and logical reasoning.  
  - OS: Study scheduling algorithms, virtual memory, process vs. thread.  
  - Networks: Focus on OSI layers, TCP/UDP, IP addressing.  
- **Strategy**:  
  1. Skim questions to prioritize familiar topics.  
  2. Use elimination for MCQs to save time.  
  3. For networks/OS, focus on definitions and standard protocols.  
- **Edge Cases**: Tricky aptitude wordings, confusing network terminology.

**Notes**:  
- Solved most questions (exact count not specified).  
- Resources: GeeksforGeeks (OS, Networks), RS Aggarwal for aptitude.  
- Tip: Practice 20-minute MCQ mocks to build speed. Aim for 80% accuracy.

### Section 2: Debugging Round

**Problem Statement**:  
- 7 questions, 20 minutes, easy difficulty.
- Goal: Fix code snippets by correcting syntax, logic, or implementing given functions to pass test cases.
- Examples: Fix loop conditions, correct operators, write logic for a function.
- Language: C++ (candidate’s choice).

**Approach**:  
- **Strategy**:  
  1. Read problem and expected output.  
  2. Identify syntax errors (e.g., missing semicolons, wrong types).  
  3. Fix logical errors (e.g., off-by-one, incorrect conditions).  
  4. Implement function logic if missing.  
  5. Test edge cases mentally (e.g., empty input, boundary values).  
- **Edge Cases**: Null inputs, zero, negative numbers, output format issues.

**Code Snippet (C++ Example)**:  
```cpp
// Example: Fix code to find max element (incorrect logic)
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Incorrect code (given)
int findMax(int arr[], int n) {
    int max = 0;  // Error: Assumes non-negative values
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (arr[i] > max) max = arr[i];
    }
    return max;
}

// Corrected code
int findMax(int arr[], int n) {
    if (n == 0) return INT_MIN;  // Edge case: empty array
    int max = arr[0];  // Fix: Initialize with first element
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        if (arr[i] > max) max = arr[i];
    }
    return max;
}
```

**Time Complexity**: O(n) for most debugging tasks.  
**Space Complexity**: O(1) or O(n) depending on problem.  
**Notes**:  
- Solved 5/7 questions.  
- Tip: Practice debugging on HackerRank/LeetCode. Focus on common errors: off-by-one, uninitialized variables. Test edge cases like empty arrays.

### Section 3: Coding Round

Three coding questions, medium difficulty, solved partially (2/3). Below are the reconstructed questions.

#### Question 1: Minimum Sublist to Sort

**Problem Statement**:  
Given an array, find the length of the shortest continuous sublist that, when sorted in increasing order, makes the entire array sorted.  
- **Example**: Input: [2,6,4,8,10,9,15] → Output: 5 (sort [6,4,8,10,9] → [4,6,8,9,10]).  
- **Explanation**: The sublist [6,4,8,10,9] (indices 1-5) is unsorted; sorting it makes the array [2,4,6,8,9,10,15] sorted.

**Approach**:  
- **Brute Force**: Try all possible sublists, sort, and check if entire array is sorted (O(n³)).  
- **Optimal Approach**: Find longest prefix and suffix that are already sorted.  
  - Pointwise:  
    1. Find rightmost index i where arr[i] > arr[i+1] (end of sorted prefix).  
    2. Find leftmost index j where arr[j-1] > arr[j] (start of sorted suffix).  
    3. Find min/max in subarray [i+1, j-1].  
    4. Extend i left if min < arr[i], extend j right if max > arr[j].  
    5. Return length (j - i + 1).  
    - Edge cases: Already sorted, single element, all same elements.

**Code Snippet (C++)**:  
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int findUnsortedSubarray(vector<int>& nums) {
    int n = nums.size();
    int i = 0, j = n - 1;
    // Find end of sorted prefix
    while (i < n - 1 && nums[i] <= nums[i + 1]) i++;
    if (i == n - 1) return 0;  // Already sorted
    // Find start of sorted suffix
    while (j > 0 && nums[j - 1] <= nums[j]) j--;
    // Find min/max in unsorted subarray
    int minVal = INT_MAX, maxVal = INT_MIN;
    for (int k = i; k <= j; k++) {
        minVal = min(minVal, nums[k]);
        maxVal = max(maxVal, nums[k]);
    }
    // Extend left if needed
    while (i > 0 && nums[i - 1] > minVal) i--;
    // Extend right if needed
    while (j < n - 1 && nums[j + 1] < maxVal) j++;
    return j - i + 1;
}
```

**Time Complexity**:  
- Brute: O(n³) for all sublists + sorting.  
- Optimal: O(n) for single pass.  
**Space Complexity**: O(1).  
**Notes**:  
- Partially solved in OA.  
- LeetCode #581 (Shortest Unsorted Continuous Subarray). Practice edge cases like [1,2,3] (sorted) or [1,1,1].

#### Question 2: Maximum Difference After Merging Intervals

**Problem Statement**:  
Given a set of intervals, merge overlapping intervals and find the interval with the maximum difference (end - start).  
- **Example**: Input: [[1,3], [2,6], [8,10], [15,18]] → Output: 5 (merge [1,3], [2,6] → [1,6], max difference = 6-1 = 5).  
- **Explanation**: Merge overlapping intervals, compute end - start for each, return maximum.

**Approach**:  
- **Brute Force**: Check all pairs for overlap, merge, and compute max difference (O(n²)).  
- **Optimal Approach**: Sort and merge intervals.  
  - Pointwise:  
    1. Sort intervals by start time.  
    2. Iterate: Merge if current start ≤ previous end, else start new interval.  
    3. Track max difference (end - start).  
    - Edge cases: Non-overlapping intervals, single interval, empty input.

**Code Snippet (C++)**:  
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int maxIntervalDifference(vector<vector<int>>& intervals) {
    if (intervals.empty()) return 0;
    sort(intervals.begin(), intervals.end());
    int maxDiff = 0, currStart = intervals[0][0], currEnd = intervals[0][1];
    for (int i = 1; i < intervals.size(); i++) {
        if (intervals[i][0] <= currEnd) {
            currEnd = max(currEnd, intervals[i][1]);
        } else {
            maxDiff = max(maxDiff, currEnd - currStart);
            currStart = intervals[i][0];
            currEnd = intervals[i][1];
        }
    }
    maxDiff = max(maxDiff, currEnd - currStart);
    return maxDiff;
}
```

**Time Complexity**:  
- Brute: O(n²).  
- Optimal: O(n log n) for sort + O(n) for merge.  
**Space Complexity**: O(1) excluding input.  
**Notes**:  
- Partially solved in OA.  
- LeetCode #56 (Merge Intervals). Test cases like [[1,2], [2,3]] (overlapping edge).

#### Question 3: Graph-Based Problem

**Problem Statement**:  
- Not fully specified, likely a standard graph problem (e.g., shortest path, connectivity, or traversal).  
- Assumed: Given a weighted graph, find the shortest path from source to destination (Dijkstra’s algorithm).

**Approach**:  
- **Brute Force**: DFS all paths, track minimum (O(V!)).  
- **Optimal Approach**: Dijkstra’s algorithm with priority queue.  
  - Pointwise:  
    1. Initialize distances to infinity, source to 0.  
    2. Use priority queue to process nodes by min distance.  
    3. Update distances for neighbors if shorter path found.  
    - Edge cases: Disconnected graph, single node, negative weights (not applicable).

**Code Snippet (C++ for Dijkstra’s)**:  
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int dijkstra(vector<vector<pair<int, int>>>& graph, int src, int dest) {
    int n = graph.size();
    vector<int> dist(n, INT_MAX);
    dist[src] = 0;
    priority_queue<pair<int, int>, vector<pair<int, int>>, greater<>> pq;
    pq.push({0, src});
    while (!pq.empty()) {
        int d = pq.top().first, u = pq.top().second;
        pq.pop();
        if (d > dist[u]) continue;
        for (auto& edge : graph[u]) {
            int v = edge.first, w = edge.second;
            if (dist[u] + w < dist[v]) {
                dist[v] = dist[u] + w;
                pq.push({dist[v], v});
            }
        }
    }
    return dist[dest] == INT_MAX ? -1 : dist[dest];
}
```

**Time Complexity**:  
- Brute: O(V!).  
- Optimal: O((V + E) log V) with priority queue.  
**Space Complexity**: O(V) for queue and distances.  
**Notes**:  
- Not solved in OA (partial attempt).  
- Likely LeetCode #743 (Network Delay Time). Practice BFS/DFS, Dijkstra’s, and edge cases like unreachable nodes.

**OA Performance**:  
- MCQs: Most solved (exact count not specified).  
- Debugging: 5/7 solved.  
- Coding: 2/3 partially solved.  
- Shortlisted for interviews after a week.

**Notes**:  
- Keep it concise, tailored to Morgan Stanley’s tech focus (e.g., finance systems).  
- Tip: Highlight projects and skills listed on resume. Practice a confident delivery.

### Question 5: Project Discussion

**Problem Statement**:  
- Discuss your project, including:  
  1. Frontend and backend technologies used.  
  2. Why you did the project.  
  3. Detailed explanation with cross-questions.

**Sample Answer**:  
- **Project**: Train Booking System  
- **Frontend/Backend**:  
  - "I used Java Swing for the frontend to create a user-friendly GUI for booking tickets. The backend was built with Java and MySQL, handling queries for seat availability and reservations."  
- **Why**:  
  - "I built this to address inefficiencies in manual booking systems, aiming to learn system design and database optimization while solving a real-world problem."  
- **Explanation**:  
  - "The system had tables for trains, seats, and bookings. I implemented features like seat selection and payment integration. I optimized queries with indexes to handle high user traffic. A challenge was ensuring concurrent bookings didn’t double-book seats, solved using transactions."  
- **Cross-Questions**:  
  - Q: How did you handle concurrency?  
  - A: "Used MySQL transactions with row-level locking to ensure data consistency."  

**Notes**:  
- Be ready for deep technical follow-ups (e.g., DB schema, optimizations).  
- Tip: Know your project’s architecture, challenges, and trade-offs. Use diagrams if asked to share screen.

### Question 6: System Design – Train Booking System

**Problem Statement**:  
- Design a train booking system, focusing on components, scalability, and database.

**Approach**:  
- **Components**:  
  1. **Frontend**: GUI for user interaction (e.g., Java Swing, React).  
  2. **Backend**: API server (Java Spring) for booking logic.  
  3. **Database**: MySQL for trains, seats, bookings.  
  4. **Cache**: Redis for seat availability to reduce DB load.  
- **Flow**:  
  1. User searches trains (GET API).  
  2. Selects seat, initiates booking (POST API).  
  3. Backend checks availability, locks seat, processes payment.  
  4. Confirms booking, updates DB.  
- **Scalability**:  
  - Use load balancer for API servers.  
  - Shard DB by train routes.  
  - Cache frequent queries (e.g., seat availability).  
- **Concurrency**: Use transactions or distributed locks.  
- **Edge Cases**: Overbooking, payment failures, high traffic.

**Notes**:  
- Discussed high-level design; interviewer likely probed DB schema or concurrency.  
- Tip: Practice system design (e.g., ticket booking, e-commerce). Study CAP theorem, sharding, caching. Resources: Grok’s system design guides, Gaurav Sen.

### Question 7: Coding – Maximum Root-to-Leaf Path Sum

**Problem Statement**:  
Given a binary tree, find the maximum sum of any root-to-leaf path.  
- **Example**: Input: [1,2,3] → Output: 4 (path: 1→3).  

**Approach**:  
- **Brute Force**: DFS all paths, track max sum (O(n)).  
- **Optimal Approach**: Recursive DFS.  
  - Pointwise:  
    1. At each node, compute max sum of left and right subtrees.  
    2. Add node value to max child sum.  
    3. Return max sum at root.  
    - Edge cases: Single node, negative values, empty tree.

**Code Snippet (C++)**:  
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left, *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

int maxPathSum(TreeNode* root) {
    if (!root) return 0;
    if (!root->left && !root->right) return root->val;
    int left = maxPathSum(root->left);
    int right = maxPathSum(root->right);
    return root->val + max(left, right);
}
```

**Time Complexity**: O(n) for visiting each node.  
**Space Complexity**: O(h) for recursion stack (h = tree height).  
**Notes**:  
- LeetCode #124 (Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum, variant). Practice negative values, unbalanced trees.

### Question 8: Coding – Sum of Elements at Each Level

**Problem Statement**:  
Given a binary tree, find the sum of node values at each level.  
- **Example**: Input: [1,2,3,4,5] → Output: [1, 5, 9] (Level 1: 1, Level 2: 2+3, Level 3: 4+5).

**Approach**:  
- **Brute Force**: DFS with level tracking, collect sums (O(n)).  
- **Optimal Approach**: BFS with level-wise processing.  
  - Pointwise:  
    1. Use queue to process nodes level by level.  
    2. For each level, sum node values.  
    3. Store sums in result vector.  
    - Edge cases: Empty tree, single node, single level.

**Code Snippet (C++)**:  
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left, *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

vector<int> levelOrderSum(TreeNode* root) {
    if (!root) return {};
    vector<int> result;
    queue<TreeNode*> q;
    q.push(root);
    while (!q.empty()) {
        int size = q.size(), sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
            TreeNode* node = q.front();
            q.pop();
            sum += node->val;
            if (node->left) q.push(node->left);
            if (node->right) q.push(node->right);
        }
        result.push_back(sum);
    }
    return result;
}
```

**Time Complexity**: O(n) for BFS.  
**Space Complexity**: O(w) where w is max width of tree.  
**Notes**:  
- LeetCode #102 (Level Order Traversal, variant). Practice with skewed trees, negative values.

### Question 9: Coding – Pairs with Difference K

**Problem Statement**:  
Given an array and integer k, find all pairs of elements whose difference equals k.  
- **Example**: Input: [3,1,4,1,5], k=2 → Output: [[1,3], [3,5]].

**Approach**:  
- **Brute Force**: Check all pairs (O(n²)).  
- **Optimal Approach**: Use hash set.  
  - Pointwise:  
    1. Store elements in hash set.  
    2. For each element x, check if x+k or x-k exists.  
    3. Collect valid pairs, avoid duplicates.  
    - Edge cases: k=0, no pairs, duplicates.

**Code Snippet (C++)**:  
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

vector<vector<int>> findPairs(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    unordered_set<int> seen;
    set<pair<int, int>> pairs;
    for (int num : nums) {
        if (seen.count(num - k)) {
            pairs.insert({min(num, num - k), max(num, num - k)});
        }
        if (seen.count(num + k)) {
            pairs.insert({min(num, num + k), max(num, num + k)});
        }
        seen.insert(num);
    }
    vector<vector<int>> result;
    for (auto& p : pairs) {
        result.push_back({p.first, p.second});
    }
    return result;
}
```

**Time Complexity**:  
- Brute: O(n²).  
- Optimal: O(n) for hash set operations.  
**Space Complexity**: O(n) for hash set and pairs.  
**Notes**:  
- LeetCode #532 (K-diff Pairs). Practice with k=0, negative k.

### Question 10: SQL – Highest Salary in Each Department

**Problem Statement**:  
Given tables `Employee` (emp_id, emp_name, dept_id, salary), `Department` (dept_id, dept_name), and `Salary` (emp_id, salary), find the highest salary in each department with employee and department names.  
- **Example Output**: [dept_name, emp_name, salary].

**Approach**:  
- Use JOINs and GROUP BY to find max salary per department.  
- Pointwise:  
  1. Join Employee and Department on dept_id.  
  2. Group by dept_id, find max salary.  
  3. Join back to get employee name for max salary.  
  - Edge cases: Empty tables, multiple employees with max salary.

**SQL Query**:  
```sql
SELECT d.dept_name, e.emp_name, MAX(e.salary) as max_salary
FROM Employee e
JOIN Department d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id
GROUP BY d.dept_id, d.dept_name
HAVING MAX(e.salary) = (
    SELECT MAX(salary)
    FROM Employee e2
    WHERE e2.dept_id = e.dept_id
);
```

**Notes**:  
- Clarify if one employee per max salary or all.  
- Tip: Practice SQL JOINs, GROUP BY on LeetCode or HackerRank. Test empty tables, ties.

### Question 11: C++ – Data Storage in Vectors

**Problem Statement**:  
- Explain how data is stored in C++ vectors, including memory allocation and resizing.

**Approach**:  
- **Explanation**:  
  - Vector is a dynamic array, stores elements contiguously in memory.  
  - Uses three pointers: begin, end, capacity end.  
  - Resizing: If size exceeds capacity, allocates new array (typically 2x), copies elements, deallocates old array.  
  - Operations: push_back (O(1) amortized), resize, reserve.  
- **Key Points**:  
  - Contiguous memory ensures cache efficiency.  
  - Resizing is O(n) when reallocation occurs.  
  - Use reserve() to preallocate and avoid frequent resizing.

**Notes**:  
- Answered with focus on memory management.  
- Tip: Study vector internals (capacity vs. size), compare with arrays/lists. Resources: C++ Reference, GeeksforGeeks.
