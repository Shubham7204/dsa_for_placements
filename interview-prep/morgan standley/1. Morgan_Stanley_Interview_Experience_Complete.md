# Morgan Stanley Interview Experience Summer Internship (On-Campus)

This document captures the complete **Morgan Stanley Summer Internship (On-Campus)** interview experience, as shared for 2025. It includes **all technical and HR questions** from the Online Assessment (OA), Technical Round, and HR+Technical Round, with detailed answers tailored for your prep. Coding questions are implemented in **C++**, and the OOPS explanation uses **Java**, as requested. Each question includes:

- **Problem Statement**: Clear, precise description (inferred or direct).
- **Approach**: Brute force (if applicable) and optimal solutions, broken down pointwise for clarity.
- **Code Snippet**: LeetCode-style, complete, and practicable in C++ (or Java for OOPS).
- **Time Complexity (TC) and Space Complexity (SC)**: For all approaches.
- **Notes**: Edge cases, interview tips, and practicable insights for acing the question.
- **HR Questions**: Sample answers, preparation tips, and situational response strategies.

The experience is based on a placement drive for 3rd-year students with a CPI cutoff of 7.5, where over 150 students applied, and 6 were shortlisted for interviews after the OA. Only one candidate secured the internship offer. Let’s dive in, bruh—this is your roadmap to crush it!

## Online Assessment (OA)

The OA lasted **1 hour 20 minutes** on the **Aspiring Minds (SHL) platform**, conducted remotely. It had three sections: Logical Reasoning (Aptitude), Debugging, and Coding. You could revisit questions within a section but not switch between sections.

### Section 1: Logical Reasoning (Aptitude)

**Problem Statement**:  
- 10 questions, 20 minutes, easy-medium difficulty.
- Topics: Permutation and Combination, Mental Ability, Quantitative Aptitude (Quants), Data Interpretation.
- Example: Calculate permutations for arranging objects, interpret sales data from a pie chart, or solve time-and-work problems.
- Challenge: Time constraints made it tough to solve all questions.

**Approach**:  
- **Preparation**: Practice quants (percentages, ratios, probability), permutations/combinations, and data interpretation (graphs, charts).  
- **Strategy**:  
  1. Skim questions first to prioritize easy ones.  
  2. Use elimination for MCQs to save time.  
  3. For data interpretation, read the question before analyzing charts.  
  4. Practice mental math to avoid lengthy calculations.  
- **Edge Cases**: Misleading data in charts, tricky wording in permutation problems.

**Notes**:  
- Solved ~75% (7-8/10 questions).  
- Resources: GeeksforGeeks Quantitative Aptitude, SHL practice tests.  
- Tip: Time management is key—aim to finish easy questions in 10-12 minutes, leaving time for tougher ones. Practice mock tests to build speed.[](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/interview-experiences/morgan-stanley-interview-experience-summer-internship-on-campus/)

### Section 2: Debugging

**Problem Statement**:  
- 7-8 questions, 20 minutes, easy-medium difficulty.
- Goal: Fix code snippets to pass all test cases by correcting syntax, logic, or reversing signs.
- Example: Fix a loop condition (e.g., `i <= n` to `i < n`), correct a logical error (e.g., wrong operator), or adjust output format.

**Approach**:  
- **Strategy**:  
  1. Read the problem and expected output carefully.  
  2. Identify syntax errors (e.g., missing semicolons, wrong variable types).  
  3. Check logical errors (e.g., off-by-one, incorrect operators).  
  4. Test edge cases mentally (e.g., empty input, zero, negative numbers).  
  5. Choose your strongest language (C++ used here).  
- **Edge Cases**: Null inputs, boundary conditions (e.g., array size 0 or 1), incorrect output formatting.

**Code Snippet (C++ Example)**:  
```cpp
// Example: Fix code to sum array elements (incorrect logic)
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Incorrect code (given)
int sumArray(int arr[], int n) {
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {  // Error: Starts at 1, uses <=
        sum += arr[i];
    }
    return sum;
}

// Corrected code
int sumArray(int arr[], int n) {
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {  // Fix: Start at 0, use <
        sum += arr[i];
    }
    return sum;
}
```

**Time Complexity**: O(n) for most debugging tasks (single pass to fix).  
**Space Complexity**: O(1) or O(n) depending on the problem.  
**Notes**:  
- Solved 80-85% (6-7/7-8 questions).  
- Tip: Practice debugging on platforms like HackerRank or LeetCode (e.g., “Debugging Challenges”). Focus on common errors: off-by-one, wrong operators, uninitialized variables.[](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/interview-experiences/morgan-stanley-interview-experience-summer-internship-on-campus/)

### Section 3: Coding Round

Three coding questions, medium-hard difficulty, 60 minutes. Candidates who recognized patterns (e.g., standard algorithms) could solve with good implementation practice. Below are the three questions, reconstructed from the experience.

#### Question 1: Chemical Elements to Scientific Formula

**Problem Statement**:  
Given an unsorted array of strings representing chemical element symbols (e.g., ["Cl", "Mg", "Cl"]), return a string in proper scientific format, sorted alphabetically by symbol, with counts for elements appearing multiple times (e.g., "Cl2Mg"). Symbols are valid (1-2 characters, first uppercase, second lowercase if present).

**Approach**:  
- **Brute Force**:  
  1. Use unordered_map to count frequencies.  
  2. Collect unique elements in a vector.  
  3. Sort vector alphabetically.  
  4. Build string: append symbol + count (if >1).  
- **Optimal Approach**:  
  1. Use map (ordered in C++) for frequency counting and auto-sorting.  
  2. Iterate map, append symbol and count (if >1).  
  - Pointwise:  
    - Count elements in map (O(n)).  
    - Map ensures alphabetical order.  
    - Append symbol; if count > 1, append count.  
    - Edge cases: Empty array -> ""; ["Na"] -> "Na"; ["Na", "Na"] -> "Na2".

**Code Snippet (C++)**:  
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

string getChemicalFormula(vector<string>& elements) {
    if (elements.empty()) return "";
    map<string, int> freq;
    for (const string& el : elements) {
        freq[el]++;
    }
    string result;
    for (const auto& pair : freq) {
        result += pair.first;
        if (pair.second > 1) {
            result += to_string(pair.second);
        }
    }
    return result;
}
```

**Time Complexity**:  
- Brute: O(n log k), n = array size, k = unique elements (vector sort).  
- Optimal: O(n log k) for map insertions.  
**Space Complexity**: O(k) for map.  
**Notes**:  
- Solved in OA.  
- Tests string manipulation, maps. Practice cases like ["H", "O", "H"] -> "H2O". Use GeeksforGeeks or LeetCode for similar problems.[](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/interview-experiences/morgan-stanley-interview-experience-summer-internship-on-campus/)

#### Question 2: Serialization and Deserialization of Binary Tree

**Problem Statement**:  
Serialize a binary tree into a string (pre-order, null as "N") and deserialize back to the tree. Nodes have integer values, left/right pointers, no cycles. Example: Tree [1,2,3] -> "1,2,N,N,3,N,N".

**Approach**:  
- **Brute Force**: Recursive pre-order serialize, queue-based deserialize.  
  - Pointwise:  
    1. Serialize: If null, append "N,"; else value + "," + left + right.  
    2. Deserialize: Split string, recurse with index/queue.  
- **Optimal Approach**: Same, optimized with vector for parsing.  
  - Pointwise:  
    1. Serialize: Build comma-separated string, "N" for null.  
    2. Deserialize: Tokenize string, recurse with index.  
    - Edge cases: Empty tree -> "N"; Single node -> "5,N,N".

**Code Snippet (C++)**:  
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left, *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

class Codec {
public:
    string serialize(TreeNode* root) {
        if (!root) return "N,";
        return to_string(root->val) + "," + serialize(root->left) + serialize(root->right);
    }
    
    TreeNode* deserialize(string data) {
        vector<string> tokens;
        string token;
        stringstream ss(data);
        while (getline(ss, token, ',')) {
            tokens.push_back(token);
        }
        int index = 0;
        return deserializeHelper(tokens, index);
    }
    
private:
    TreeNode* deserializeHelper(vector<string>& tokens, int& index) {
        if (index >= tokens.size() || tokens[index] == "N") {
            index++;
            return nullptr;
        }
        TreeNode* node = new TreeNode(stoi(tokens[index++]));
        node.left = deserializeHelper(tokens, index);
        node.right = deserializeHelper(tokens, index);
        return node;
    }
};
```

**Time Complexity**: O(n) for serialize/deserialize.  
**Space Complexity**: O(n) for recursion stack, tokens.  
**Notes**:  
- Solved in OA.  
- LeetCode #297. Practice N-ary tree or level-order variations. Test unbalanced trees.[](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/interview-experiences/morgan-stanley-interview-experience-summer-internship-on-campus/)

#### Question 3: Graph with Greedy + DSU

**Problem Statement**:  
Given an undirected graph with n nodes and edges {u, v, w} (nodes u, v, weight w), find minimum cost to connect all nodes (Kruskal’s MST). Return -1 if impossible.

**Approach**:  
- **Brute Force**: Try all edge subsets, check connectivity (O(e!)).  
- **Optimal Approach**: Kruskal’s with DSU.  
  - Pointwise:  
    1. Sort edges by weight.  
    2. Initialize DSU (parent, rank).  
    3. Iterate edges: If different components, union and add weight.  
    4. Check if one component remains.  
    - Edge cases: Disconnected graph, single node, empty edges.

**Code Snippet (C++)**:  
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

struct Edge {
    int u, v, w;
    bool operator<(const Edge& other) const { return w < other.w; }
};

class DSU {
    vector<int> parent, rank;
public:
    DSU(int n) : parent(n), rank(n, 0) {
        iota(parent.begin(), parent.end(), 0);
    }
    int find(int x) {
        if (parent[x] != x) parent[x] = find(parent[x]);
        return parent[x];
    }
    void unite(int x, int y) {
        int px = find(x), py = find(y);
        if (px == py) return;
        if (rank[px] < rank[py]) swap(px, py);
        parent[py] = px;
        if (rank[px] == rank[py]) rank[px]++;
    }
};

int minCostConnect(int n, vector<Edge>& edges) {
    sort(edges.begin(), edges.end());
    DSU dsu(n);
    int cost = 0, components = n;
    for (const auto& e : edges) {
        if (dsu.find(e.u) != dsu.find(e.v)) {
            dsu.unite(e.u, e.v);
            cost += e.w;
            components--;
        }
    }
    return components == 1 ? cost : -1;
}
```

**Time Complexity**:  
- Brute: O(e!).  
- Optimal: O(e log e) for sort + O(e α(n)) for DSU.  
**Space Complexity**: O(n + e).  
**Notes**:  
- Not solved in OA (tricky greedy + DSU).  
- LeetCode #1135. Practice DSU optimizations, test disconnected graphs.[](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/interview-experiences/morgan-stanley-interview-experience-summer-internship-on-campus/)

**OA Performance**:  
- Logical Reasoning: ~75% (7-8/10).  
- Debugging: 80-85% (6-7/7-8).  
- Coding: 2/3 solved (chemical formula, serialization/deserialization).  
- 6/150 students shortlisted for interviews.

## Interview Round 1 (Technical)

**Duration**: 1 hour 20 minutes.  
**Format**: Zoom, with screen sharing for coding and OOPS design.  
**Interviewer**: Friendly, provided hints, focused on thought process.

### Question 4: Introduction

**Problem Statement**:  
- Provide a 1-2 minute introduction covering skills and interests.

**Sample Answer**:  
- "Hi, I’m [Your Name], a 3rd-year B.Tech student in [Branch] with a CPI of [Your CPI]. I’m passionate about problem-solving through coding, especially in data structures and algorithms. I’ve worked on projects like a DBMS-based inventory system, where I implemented efficient querying using SQL. My skills include C++, Java, and Python, and I enjoy tackling real-world problems like scheduling or graph algorithms. Outside academics, I’m involved in [e.g., coding clubs, hackathons], and I’m excited to contribute to Morgan Stanley’s innovative tech solutions."

**Notes**:  
- Keep it concise (1-2 minutes). Highlight technical skills, projects, and enthusiasm for the role.  
- Tip: Tailor to Morgan Stanley’s tech focus (e.g., financial systems, algorithms). Practice a confident delivery.[](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/interview-experiences/morgan-stanley-interview-experience-summer-internship-on-campus/)

### Question 5: DBMS Project Discussion

**Problem Statement**:  
- Explain your DBMS project briefly.  
- Propose a solution for a real-life problem based on the project.  
- Example: If project is an inventory system, solve a problem like optimizing stock queries.

**Sample Answer**:  
- **Project Explanation**:  
  - "My DBMS project is an inventory management system built using MySQL. It tracks products, quantities, and sales, with tables for products, orders, and suppliers. I implemented queries for stock updates, sales reports, and low-stock alerts, optimizing them with indexes for faster retrieval."  
- **Real-Life Problem**:  
  - Problem: "How would you handle a sudden stock shortage alert for multiple warehouses?"  
  - Solution:  
    1. Query all warehouses for stock levels (SELECT with JOIN).  
    2. Identify shortages (WHERE quantity < threshold).  
    3. Trigger automated supplier orders using stored procedures.  
    4. Optimize with indexes on quantity and warehouse ID.  
  - Interviewer Feedback: Suggested only first approach (query-based) was correct; others (e.g., caching) depended on it.

**Notes**:  
- Be concise but detailed about project’s purpose, tech stack, and your contribution.  
- For real-life problems, propose multiple approaches but wait for interviewer feedback before elaborating.  
- Tip: Know your project inside-out, including DB schema and query optimizations.[](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/interview-experiences/morgan-stanley-interview-experience-summer-internship-on-campus/)

### Question 6: Explain OOPS with Earbuds Object

**Problem Statement**:  
- Explain the four OOPS pillars (Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism) by designing a class for Earbuds (attributes: brand, batteryLife; methods: playMusic, charge). Use Java, present on notepad during interview.

**Approach**:  
- **Pillars**:  
  1. **Abstraction**: Hide implementation details, expose simple interface (e.g., playMusic hides audio processing).  
  2. **Encapsulation**: Private fields (brand, batteryLife), public getters/setters.  
  3. **Inheritance**: Subclass WirelessEarbuds extends Earbuds.  
  4. **Polymorphism**: Override playMusic for wireless-specific behavior.  
- **Design**:  
  - Base abstract class `Earbuds` with attributes and methods.  
  - Subclass `WirelessEarbuds` for inheritance/polymorphism.  
  - Demonstrate on notepad, explaining each pillar.

**Code Snippet (Java)**:  
```java
public abstract class Earbuds {
    private String brand;  // Encapsulation: private
    private int batteryLife;  // in hours
    
    public Earbuds(String brand, int batteryLife) {
        this.brand = brand;
        this.batteryLife = batteryLife;
    }
    
    // Encapsulation: Getters/Setters
    public String getBrand() { return brand; }
    public void setBatteryLife(int batteryLife) { this.batteryLife = batteryLife; }
    
    // Abstraction: Method interface
    public abstract void playMusic();
    
    public void charge() {
        batteryLife += 2;
        System.out.println("Charging... Battery now: " + batteryLife + " hours.");
    }
}

public class WirelessEarbuds extends Earbuds {
    public WirelessEarbuds(String brand, int batteryLife) {
        super(brand, batteryLife);
    }
    
    // Polymorphism: Override
    @Override
    public void playMusic() {
        System.out.println("Playing music wirelessly on " + getBrand() + " earbuds.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Earbuds earbuds = new WirelessEarbuds("Sony", 10);
        earbuds.playMusic();  // Polymorphism
        earbuds.charge();
    }
}
```

**Time Complexity**: N/A (design question).  
**Space Complexity**: O(1) per instance.  
**Notes**:  
- Interviewer was satisfied after guiding thought process.  
- Tip: Practice explaining OOPS with objects like Car or Phone. Be ready to code on notepad and discuss trade-offs (e.g., abstract vs. interface).[](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/interview-experiences/morgan-stanley-interview-experience-summer-internship-on-campus/)

### Question 7: Job Scheduling Algorithm (Real-Life Based)

**Problem Statement**:  
Design a job scheduling algorithm to maximize non-overlapping jobs, given an array of jobs with {startTime, duration}. Output: maximum number of jobs. Example: Jobs [{0, 2}, {1, 1}, {3, 2}] -> 2 (select {0, 2}, {3, 2}).

**Approach**:  
- **Brute Force**: Try all subsets, check for non-overlapping (O(2^n)).  
- **Optimal Approach**: Greedy, sort by end time.  
  - Pointwise:  
    1. Create intervals {start, end} (end = start + duration).  
    2. Sort by end time.  
    3. Pick job if start ≥ last selected job’s end.  
    4. Count selected jobs.  
    - Edge cases: Overlapping jobs, empty array, same end time.

**Code Snippet (C++)**:  
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

struct Job {
    int start, duration;
};

int maxJobs(vector<Job>& jobs) {
    vector<pair<int, int>> intervals;
    for (const auto& job : jobs) {
        intervals.emplace_back(job.start, job.start + job.duration);
    }
    sort(intervals.begin(), intervals.end(), [](const auto& a, const auto& b) {
        return a.second < b.second;  // Sort by end time
    });
    int count = 0, lastEnd = -1;
    for (const auto& interval : intervals) {
        if (interval.first >= lastEnd) {
            count++;
            lastEnd = interval.second;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

**Time Complexity**:  
- Brute: O(2^n).  
- Optimal: O(n log n) for sort + O(n) for iteration.  
**Space Complexity**: O(n) for intervals.  
**Notes**:  
- Solved with pseudo-code, passed interviewer’s edge cases.  
- LeetCode #435 (Non-overlapping Intervals). Practice weighted scheduling or priority-based variants.[](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/interview-experiences/morgan-stanley-interview-experience-summer-internship-on-campus/)

### Question 8: Efficient Algorithm Using Stack

**Problem Statement**:  
Find the next greater element for each element in an array (right side). Return -1 if none. Example: [4, 5, 2, 25] -> [5, 25, 25, -1]. Interviewer hinted at using a stack for efficiency after brute force discussion.

**Approach**:  
- **Brute Force**: For each element, scan right for first greater (O(n²)).  
- **Optimal Approach**: Monotonic stack.  
  - Pointwise:  
    1. Initialize result with -1.  
    2. Use stack for indices.  
    3. For each element: Pop stack if current > stack top’s element, update result.  
    4. Push current index.  
    - Edge cases: Empty array, all same elements, increasing/decreasing sequence.

**Code Snippet (C++)**:  
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

vector<int> nextGreaterElement(vector<int>& nums) {
    int n = nums.size();
    vector<int> result(n, -1);
    stack<int> st;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        while (!st.empty() && nums[i] > nums[st.top()]) {
            result[st.top()] = nums[i];
            st.pop();
        }
        st.push(i);
    }
    return result;
}
```

**Time Complexity**:  
- Brute: O(n²).  
- Optimal: O(n) (each element pushed/popped once).  
**Space Complexity**: O(n) for stack, result.  
**Notes**:  
- Solved after interviewer’s stack hint; they were satisfied.  
- LeetCode #496 or #739 (Daily Temperatures). Practice stack-based problems (histogram, parentheses).[](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/interview-experiences/morgan-stanley-interview-experience-summer-internship-on-campus/)

### Question 9: Questions to Interviewer

**Problem Statement**:  
- Ask questions about the interviewer’s domain, profile, or Morgan Stanley’s work culture.

**Sample Questions**:  
- "What kind of projects does the technology team at Morgan Stanley work on, especially for summer interns?"  
- "How does Morgan Stanley leverage technology to innovate in financial services?"  
- "What’s the most exciting aspect of working in your domain at Morgan Stanley?"  

**Notes**:  
- Interviewer answered gently, appreciated engagement.  
- Tip: Prepare 2-3 questions about tech stack, team dynamics, or work culture. Shows interest and builds rapport.[](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/interview-experiences/morgan-stanley-interview-experience-summer-internship-on-campus/)

**Round 1 Outcome**: 2/6 candidates advanced to Round 2.

I’m eager to contribute to impactful projects and learn from senior leaders during the internship."  
- **Team Member Not Contributing**:  
  - "In a group project, one member was missing deadlines. I initiated a private conversation to understand their challenges, learned they were overwhelmed, and suggested redistributing tasks. I also set up regular check-ins to keep everyone accountable. This improved our collaboration, and we delivered on time."  
- **Challenge Faced**:  
  - "During a hackathon, our team struggled with a buggy algorithm. I took the lead to debug systematically, isolating the issue to an edge case. We fixed it by adding boundary checks, and our project won second place. This taught me persistence and structured problem-solving."  
- **Strengths and Weaknesses**:  
  - "My strength is problem-solving under pressure, like optimizing code during tight deadlines. My weakness is overanalyzing details sometimes, but I’m improving by setting time limits for decisions and focusing on the bigger picture."  
- **Five-Year Plan**:  
  - "In five years, I see myself as a skilled software engineer, specializing in financial systems. I hope to grow at Morgan Stanley, taking on challenging projects and mentoring interns, while deepening my expertise in algorithms and system design."

**Notes**:  
- Use STAR method for situational questions. Research Morgan Stanley’s core values (e.g., integrity, excellence) for “Why Morgan Stanley?”  
- Tip: Prepare 2-3 stories for teamwork, leadership, and challenges. Be honest about weaknesses, showing self-awareness and improvement.[](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/interview-experiences/morgan-stanley-interview-experience-summer-internship-on-campus/)[](https://www.ambitionbox.com/interviews/morgan-stanley-interview-questions)

### Question 15: Stack and Basic Math

**Problem Statement**:  
Evaluate an arithmetic expression (e.g., "3 + 5 * 2") with operators +, -, *, /, and integers (no parentheses). Return the result. Example: "3 + 5 * 2" -> 13.

**Approach**:  
- **Brute Force**: Left-to-right evaluation (incorrect due to precedence).  
- **Optimal Approach**: Two stacks for numbers and operators, handle precedence.  
  - Pointwise:  
    1. Tokenize string (numbers, operators).  
    2. Push numbers to num stack, operators to op stack.  
    3. Process higher/equal precedence operators when adding new operator.  
    4. Process remaining operators.  
    - Edge cases: Single number, spaces, division by zero (assume valid input).

**Code Snippet (C++)**:  
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int precedence(char op) {
    if (op == '+' || op == '-') return 1;
    if (op == '*' || op == '/') return 2;
    return 0;
}

int applyOp(int a, int b, char op) {
    if (op == '+') return a + b;
    if (op == '-') return a - b;
    if (op == '*') return a * b;
    return a / b;
}

int evaluateExpression(string s) {
    stack<int> nums;
    stack<char> ops;
    for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); ++i) {
        if (s[i] == ' ') continue;
        if (isdigit(s[i])) {
            int num = 0;
            while (i < s.length() && isdigit(s[i])) {
                num = num * 10 + (s[i] - '0');
                i++;
            }
            nums.push(num);
            i--;
        } else {
            while (!ops.empty() && precedence(ops.top()) >= precedence(s[i])) {
                int b = nums.top(); nums.pop();
                int a = nums.top(); nums.pop();
                char op = ops.top(); ops.pop();
                nums.push(applyOp(a, b, op));
            }
            ops.push(s[i]);
        }
    }
    while (!ops.empty()) {
        int b = nums.top(); nums.pop();
        int a = nums.top(); nums.pop();
        char op = ops.top(); ops.pop();
        nums.push(applyOp(a, b, op));
    }
    return nums.top();
}
```

**Time Complexity**: O(n) for single pass + stack operations.  
**Space Complexity**: O(n) for stacks.

## Final Tips and Suggestions

- **Be Honest with Your Resume**: Only include skills/projects you can explain deeply. Interviewers may dive into every detail. [Don’t Fake It!]  
- **Think Aloud**: Verbalize your thought process while solving technical questions. Ask clarifying questions and discuss trade-offs to engage the interviewer.  
- **Stay Calm and Confident**: Take time to understand problems. If stuck, explain your approach and seek hints calmly.  
- **Edge Cases**: Always test code for empty inputs, single elements, or extremes (e.g., zero, negative numbers).  
- **OOPS Prep**: Practice designing classes for real-world objects (e.g., Car, Phone). Be ready to explain pillars and code on notepad.  
- **HR Prep**: Use STAR method for situational questions. Research Morgan Stanley’s values (integrity, excellence) and align answers. Prepare stories for teamwork, leadership, and challenges.  
- **Resources**:  
  - GeeksforGeeks for DSA, OOPS, DBMS, and interview experiences.  
  - LeetCode for coding practice (medium-hard problems).  
  - SHL/Aspiring Minds mock tests for aptitude and debugging.  
- **Interview Day**: Get good rest (interviews were next day after OA results). Brush up on resume projects and core CS topics (DSA, OOPS, DBMS).
