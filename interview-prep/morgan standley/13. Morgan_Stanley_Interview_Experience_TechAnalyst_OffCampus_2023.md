## Online Test

The OT was conducted on the SHL Aspiring Minds platform, with three sections: Debugging, Aptitude, and Programming. The IDE was slow, impacting debugging.

### Section 1: Debugging

**Problem Statement**:  
- 7 questions, time-constrained (likely 10–20 minutes), C++ chosen.  
- Task: Fix bugs (syntax/logic) and complete code (2 questions involved filling blanks or adding functionality).  
- Topics: Basic syntax, logic errors, small algorithmic tasks.  
- Solved 6/7.

**Approach**:  
- **Strategy**:  
  1. Identify syntax errors (e.g., missing semicolons, incorrect types).  
  2. Fix logical errors (e.g., wrong conditions, loop bounds).  
  3. For code completion, implement required functionality (e.g., array sum).  
- **Edge Cases**: Null inputs, boundary values, uninitialized variables.

**Notes**:  
- Slow IDE was a challenge; focus on speed.  
- Resources: GFG Debugging Practice, HackerRank.  
- Tip: Practice 5-minute debug and code completion, aim for 7/7.

### Section 2: Aptitude

**Problem Statement**:  
- Unspecified number of questions, time-constrained (likely 10–20 minutes), tricky for time given.  
- Topics: Logical Reasoning (pattern recognition), Data Interpretation (charts), Numerical Ability (calculations).  
- Unsure of exact performance.

**Approach**:  
- **Strategy**:  
  1. Prioritize numerical questions (e.g., percentages, ratios).  
  2. Solve logical puzzles using elimination.  
  3. Manage time tightly, avoid overthinking.  
- **Edge Cases**: Tricky wording, time traps.

**Notes**:  
- Time management critical.  
- Resources: RS Aggarwal, GFG Aptitude.  
- Tip: Practice 10-minute aptitude sets, aim for 80% accuracy.

### Section 3: Programming

**Problem Statement**:  
- 3 easy questions, likely 60 minutes, C++ chosen.  
- Topics: Array manipulation, basic graph structure (e.g., traversal).  
- Solved all 3.

**Approach (Assumed Questions)**:  
- **Question 1**: Array manipulation (e.g., max sum subarray).  
- **Question 2**: Array/string processing (e.g., remove duplicates).  
- **Question 3**: Basic graph (e.g., BFS on adjacency list).  
- **Strategy**:  
  1. Write brute-force solution to secure points.  
  2. Optimize using standard DSA techniques (e.g., Kadane’s, BFS).  
  3. Test edge cases manually.  
- **Edge Cases**: Empty inputs, single element, disconnected graph.

**Sample Code (C++ - Max Sum Subarray)**:  
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int maxSubArray(vector<int>& nums) {
    int maxSum = nums[0], currSum = nums[0];
    for (int i = 1; i < nums.size(); i++) {
        currSum = max(nums[i], currSum + nums[i]);
        maxSum = max(maxSum, currSum);
    }
    return maxSum;
}
```

**Time Complexity**: O(n).  
**Space Complexity**: O(1).  
**Notes**:  
- Solved all, likely passed all test cases.  
- Resources: LeetCode #53, GFG Graph.  
- Tip: Practice easy-medium DSA, ensure full test case coverage.

**OT Performance**:  
- Debugging: 6/7; Aptitude: decent; Coding: 3/3.  
- Shortlisted for Technical Interview after 3 days.

## Technical Interview (Round 1)

**Duration**: ~45–60 minutes, via virtual platform, friendly interviewer.  
**Focus**: C++ basics, coding, OOPS concepts.

### Question 1: Find Errors in C++ Code

**Problem Statement**:  
- Identify errors in the given C++ code:  
```cpp
#include<vector.h>
void main(int r1, char **r2) {
    int n;
    if (r1 > 1)
        n = r2[0];
    int *stuff = new int[n];
    vector<int> v(100000);
    delete stuff;
    return 0;
}
```

**Approach**:  
- **Errors Identified**:  
  1. **Header**: `<vector.h>` is incorrect; should be `<vector>` with `using namespace std;` or `std::vector`.  
  2. **Main Signature**: `void main` is non-standard; should be `int main`.  
  3. **Type Mismatch**: `n = r2[0]` assigns `char*` to `int`; should convert `r2[1]` (first argument) using `atoi(r2[1])`.  
  4. **Memory Leak**: `delete stuff` should be `delete[] stuff` for array deallocation.  
  5. **Uninitialized `n`**: If `r1 <= 1`, `n` is uninitialized, causing undefined behavior.  
  6. **Return Type**: `return 0` is fine, but `main` should return `int`.  
- **Corrected Code**:  
```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    int n = 0;
    if (argc > 1) {
        n = atoi(argv[1]);
    }
    int *stuff = new int[n];
    vector<int> v(100000);
    delete[] stuff;
    return 0;
}
```

**Notes**:  
- Identified key errors, explained fixes.  
- Tip: Practice C++ syntax errors (GFG C++).

### Question 2: Minimum Number of Chairs (Platforms)

**Problem Statement**:  
- Given employees’ arrival and departure times, find the minimum number of chairs required.  
- **Example**: Input: arr=[1,2,3], dep=[2,4,3] → Output: 2.  
- **Link**: [GFG - Minimum Platforms](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/minimum-number-platforms-required-railwaybus-station/).

**Approach**:  
- **Brute Force**: Check overlaps for each employee (O(n²)).  
- **Optimal Approach**: Sort and two-pointer.  
  - Pointwise:  
    1. Sort arrival and departure arrays.  
    2. Use two pointers to track active employees (increment on arrival, decrement on departure).  
    3. Track max chairs needed.  
    - Edge cases: Same arrival/departure, single employee.

**Code Snippet (C++)**:  
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int minChairs(vector<int>& arr, vector<int>& dep) {
    int n = arr.size();
    sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());
    sort(dep.begin(), dep.end());
    int chairs = 0, maxChairs = 0, i = 0, j = 0;
    while (i < n && j < n) {
        if (arr[i] <= dep[j]) {
            chairs++;
            maxChairs = max(maxChairs, chairs);
            i++;
        } else {
            chairs--;
            j++;
        }
    }
    return maxChairs;
}
```

**Time Complexity**: O(n log n) for sorting.  
**Space Complexity**: O(1).  
**Notes**:  
- Initial approach suboptimal, time ran out for optimization.  
- LeetCode #253 variant. Test same times, single employee.

### Question 3: Overloading in C++

**Problem Statement**:  
- Explain function and operator overloading in C++.

**Approach**:  
- **Function Overloading**: Same function name, different parameters (number/type).  
  - Example: `void print(int)`, `void print(double)`.  
- **Operator Overloading**: Redefine operators (e.g., `+` for custom class).  
  - Example: Overload `+` for a `Complex` class.  
- **Code Example**:  
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Complex {
public:
    int real, imag;
    Complex(int r, int i) : real(r), imag(i) {}
    Complex operator+(const Complex& other) {
        return Complex(real + other.real, imag + other.imag);
    }
};
```

**Notes**:  
- Explained clearly.  
- Tip: Study C++ overloading (GFG C++).

### Question 4: Smart Pointers in C++

**Problem Statement**:  
- Explain smart pointers in C++.

**Approach**:  
- **Explanation**:  
  - Manage dynamic memory automatically, prevent leaks.  
  - Types:  
    - `unique_ptr`: Single ownership, non-copyable.  
    - `shared_ptr`: Multiple owners, reference counting.  
    - `weak_ptr`: Non-owning reference to `shared_ptr`.  
  - Example: `shared_ptr<int> sp = make_shared<int>(10);`.  
- **Edge Cases**: Circular references, dangling pointers.

**Notes**:  
- Answered well.  
- Tip: Study C++11 smart pointers (GFG C++).

**Technical Interview Performance**:  
- Handled C++ questions well, struggled with chairs optimization.  
- Advanced to Technical + HR Interview after 5 days.

## Technical + HR Interview (Round 2)

**Duration**: ~45–60 minutes, via virtual platform, 4 days after Round 1.  
**Focus**: Elasticsearch project, technical discussion, HR questions.

### Question 5: Elasticsearch Project Discussion

**Problem Statement**:  
- Discuss recent Elasticsearch project, implement in C++, focus on inverted indices.

**Approach**:  
- **Project Overview**:  
  - Used Elasticsearch for full-text search in a web app.  
  - Key feature: Fast query response using inverted indices.  
- **Inverted Index in C++**:  
  - **Structure**: Map of words to list of document IDs.  
  - **Implementation**: Use `unordered_map` for O(1) lookup, linked list or vector for document list.  
  - **Choice Discussion**:  
    - Initially chose linked list for O(1) insertion/deletion.  
    - Revised to vector for better space efficiency (no prev/next pointers).  
- **Code Example (C++)**:  
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class InvertedIndex {
    unordered_map<string, vector<int>> index;
public:
    void addDocument(int docID, const string& content) {
        stringstream ss(content);
        string word;
        while (ss >> word) {
            index[word].push_back(docID);
        }
    }
    vector<int> search(const string& word) {
        return index.count(word) ? index[word] : vector<int>();
    }
};
```

**Notes**:  
- Detailed discussion, clarified vector vs. linked list.
