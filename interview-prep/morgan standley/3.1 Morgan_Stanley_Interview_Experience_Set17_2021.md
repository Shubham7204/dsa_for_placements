### Section 2: Coding Questions

Two coding questions, both solved.

#### Question 1: Shortest Path Between Servers

**Problem Statement**:  
Given a network of N servers connected by E bidirectional cables with latency L, find the shortest path between pairs of servers for K test cases.  
- **Input**:  
  - Line 1: N (servers), E (cables), L (latency).  
  - E lines: S (source), D (destination).  
  - Line E+1: K (test cases).  
  - K lines: S (source), D (destination).  
- **Output**: Shortest path length for each test case.  
- **Constraints**: 1≤N≤1000, 1≤L≤400, 1≤K≤10^9.  
- **Example**: N=4, E=4, L=1, edges=[(1,2), (2,3), (3,4), (1,4)], K=2, queries=[(1,3), (2,4)] → Output: [2, 2].

**Approach**:  
- **Brute Force**: DFS for each test case (O(K*(V+E))).  
- **Optimal Approach**: BFS with precomputed distances (O(N^2) preprocessing).  
  - Pointwise:  
    1. Build adjacency matrix (unweighted, L=1 per edge).  
    2. Precompute all-pairs shortest paths using BFS or Floyd-Warshall.  
    3. For each query, return distance from matrix.  
    - Edge cases: Disconnected graph, single server, K=10^9 (precompute).

**Code Snippet (C++)**:  
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

vector<vector<int>> shortestPaths(int N, int L, vector<pair<int, int>>& edges) {
    vector<vector<int>> adj(N + 1, vector<int>(N + 1, INT_MAX));
    for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) adj[i][i] = 0;
    for (auto& e : edges) {
        adj[e.first][e.second] = L;
        adj[e.second][e.first] = L;
    }
    // Floyd-Warshall for all-pairs shortest paths
    for (int k = 1; k <= N; k++) {
        for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= N; j++) {
                if (adj[i][k] != INT_MAX && adj[k][j] != INT_MAX) {
                    adj[i][j] = min(adj[i][j], adj[i][k] + adj[k][j]);
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return adj;
}

vector<int> solveQueries(vector<vector<int>>& adj, vector<pair<int, int>>& queries) {
    vector<int> result;
    for (auto& q : queries) {
        int dist = adj[q.first][q.second];
        result.push_back(dist == INT_MAX ? -1 : dist);
    }
    return result;
}
```

**Time Complexity**:  
- Brute: O(K*(V+E)).  
- Optimal: O(N^3) preprocessing, O(1) per query.  
**Space Complexity**: O(N^2) for adjacency matrix.  
**Notes**:  
- Solved; used Floyd-Warshall due to K≤10^9.  
- GFG “Shortest Path in Undirected Graph.” Test disconnected graphs.

#### Question 2: Nth Number with Digits 0-5

**Problem Statement**:  
Find the Nth number containing only digits 0-5, in ascending order.  
- **Example**: Input: N=6 → Output: 10 (sequence: 0,1,2,3,4,5,10,11,…).  
- **Constraints**: 1≤N≤10^9.

**Approach**:  
- **Brute Force**: Generate numbers, filter digits (O(N)).  
- **Optimal Approach**: Treat as base-6 number (digits 0-5).  
  - Pointwise:  
    1. Convert N-1 to base-6 (0-based index).  
    2. Construct number from base-6 digits.  
    - Edge cases: N=1, large N.

**Code Snippet (C++)**:  
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

long long findNthNumber(long long N) {
    N--; // 0-based
    vector<int> digits;
    while (N > 0) {
        digits.push_back(N % 6);
        N /= 6;
    }
    if (digits.empty()) return 0;
    long long result = 0;
    for (int i = digits.size() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        result = result * 10 + digits[i];
    }
    return result;
}
```

**Time Complexity**: O(log N) for base-6 conversion.  
**Space Complexity**: O(log N) for digits.  
**Notes**:  
- Solved; base-6 conversion key.  
- GFG “Nth number in a given range.” Test large N.

**OA Performance**:  
- Solved most MCQs, both coding questions.  
- 25 shortlisted for Technical Round 1.

## Technical Round 1

**Duration**: 45-60 minutes, via Zoom.  
**Interviewer**: Convivial, focused on technologies, OOPS, DSA, system design.

### Question 3: Technologies Explored and Problems Solved

**Problem Statement**:  
- What technologies have you explored? What problems did you solve?

**Sample Answer**:  
- **Technologies**: "I’ve worked with Java, Python, NodeJS, and MySQL. Built a web app using NodeJS for real-time analytics and a Java-based booking system."  
- **Problems**: "The web app optimized data retrieval with caching, solving latency issues. The booking system handled concurrent bookings using transactions."

**Notes**:  
- Highlighted web dev experience.  
- Tip: Tie projects to Morgan Stanley’s tech stack (e.g., Java, NodeJS). Prepare for follow-ups.

### Question 4: Vtables in C++

**Problem Statement**:  
- What are vtables? (Candidate unaware, interviewer challenged as CS basic.)

**Approach**:  
- **Vtables**:  
  - Virtual table stores pointers to virtual functions for dynamic dispatch.  
  - Each class with virtual functions has a vtable.  
  - Objects store vptr pointing to vtable.  
- **Example**: Base class with virtual function, derived class overrides, vtable resolves call.

**Notes**:  
- Didn’t know; interviewer moved on.  
- Tip: Study C++ polymorphism (GFG, C++ Reference). Be honest if unsure, pivot to strengths.

### Question 5: Find Missing Element in Sorted Array

**Problem Statement**:  
- Find missing element in sorted array of numbers from 1 to N.  
- **Example**: Input: [1,2,4,5] → Output: 3.

**Approach**:  
- **Brute Force**: Scan array for gap (O(n)).  
- **Optimal Approach**: Binary search.  
  - Pointwise:  
    1. If arr[i] != i+1, missing is i+1.  
    2. Use binary search to find first mismatch.  
    - Edge cases: Missing at start/end, no missing.

**Code Snippet (C++)**:  
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int findMissing(vector<int>& arr) {
    int left = 0, right = arr.size() - 1;
    while (left <= right) {
        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
        if (arr[mid] == mid + 1) left = mid + 1;
        else right = mid - 1;
    }
    return left + 1;
}
```

**Time Complexity**:  
- Brute: O(n).  
- Optimal: O(log n).  
**Space Complexity**: O(1).  
**Notes**:  
- Solved; simple problem.  
- LeetCode #268 variant. Test missing at boundaries.

### Question 6: REST vs. SOAP

**Problem Statement**:  
- Explain differences between REST and SOAP.

**Approach**:  
- **REST**:  
  - Stateless, uses HTTP methods (GET, POST).  
  - Lightweight, JSON/XML, flexible.  
  - Example: Web APIs.  
- **SOAP**:  
  - Stateful, protocol-based (XML).  
  - Strict standards, built-in security (WS-Security).  
  - Example: Enterprise systems.  
- **Use Cases**: REST for web, SOAP for secure transactions.

**Notes**:  
- Answered based on web dev experience.  
- Tip: Study REST principles, HTTP methods. Resources: GFG, Mozilla Docs.

### Question 7: Runtime Polymorphism in Java

**Problem Statement**:  
- How is runtime polymorphism implemented in Java? Explain JVM’s role.

**Approach**:  
- **Polymorphism**: Achieved via method overriding, interfaces.  
- **JVM Role**:  
  - Uses dynamic method dispatch.  
  - Method table (similar to vtable) resolves calls at runtime.  
  - Example: `Animal a = new Dog(); a.speak();` calls Dog’s method.  
- **Implementation**: If designing, use method table per class, resolve via object’s type.

**Code Snippet (Java Example)**:  
```java
interface Animal {
    void speak();
}

class Dog implements Animal {
    public void speak() { System.out.println("Woof"); }
}

class Cat implements Animal {
    public void speak() { System.out.println("Meow"); }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal a = new Dog();
        a.speak(); // Calls Dog's speak()
    }
}
```

**Notes**:  
- Answered without language specs, satisfied interviewer.  
- Tip: Study JVM internals, method dispatch. Resources: Oracle Java Docs.

### Question 8: Sentence Made of Dictionary Words

**Problem Statement**:  
- Given a dictionary of words and a sentence, check if the sentence is made only of dictionary words.  
- **Example**: Dictionary: {"My", "name", "is", "XYZ"}, Sentence: "XYZisMyname" → Output: True.

**Approach**:  
- **Brute Force**: Try all substring splits (O(2^n)).  
- **Optimal Approach**: Trie-based.  
  - Pointwise:  
    1. Build Trie from dictionary words.  
    2. Use DP to check if sentence can be segmented.  
    3. For each position, check if prefix is in Trie, recurse.  
    - Edge cases: Empty sentence, no valid segmentation.

**Code Snippet (C++)**:  
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

struct TrieNode {
    bool isEnd;
    unordered_map<char, TrieNode*> children;
    TrieNode() : isEnd(false) {}
};

class Trie {
    TrieNode* root;
public:
    Trie() { root = new TrieNode(); }
    void insert(string word) {
        TrieNode* curr = root;
        for (char c : word) {
            if (!curr->children.count(c)) curr->children[c] = new TrieNode();
            curr = curr->children[c];
        }
        curr->isEnd = true;
    }
    bool canSegment(string s) {
        vector<bool> dp(s.size() + 1, false);
        dp[0] = true;
        for (int i = 1; i <= s.size(); i++) {
            TrieNode* curr = root;
            for (int j = i; j >= 1 && curr; j--) {
                if (!curr->children.count(s[j-1])) break;
                curr = curr->children[s[j-1]];
                if (curr->isEnd && dp[j-1]) dp[i] = true;
            }
        }
        return dp[s.size()];
    }
};
```

**Time Complexity**:  
- Brute: O(2^n).  
- Optimal: O(n*m) (m = avg word length).  
**Space Complexity**: O(n + W) (W = dictionary size).  
**Notes**:  
- Used Trie, improved after interviewer feedback.  
- LeetCode #139 (Word Break). Test with long sentences.

### Question 9: Forklift Warehouse System Design

**Problem Statement**:  
- Design a system to manage forklifts in a warehouse, ensuring no collisions and optimal paths. Include algorithms, data structures, classes.

**Approach**:  
- **Requirements**:  
  - Track forklift positions, destinations.  
  - Avoid collisions, optimize paths.  
- **Data Structures**:  
  - Graph: Warehouse as grid, nodes for positions, edges for paths.  
  - Priority Queue: For shortest paths (Dijkstra’s).  
  - Set: Track occupied positions.  
- **Classes (Java)**:  
  - `Forklift`: ID, position, destination, path.  
  - `Warehouse`: Grid, forklifts, collision detection.  
  - `PathFinder`: Computes optimal paths.  
- **Algorithm**:  
  1. Use Dijkstra’s for shortest path per forklift.  
  2. Check collisions by reserving time slots for grid cells.  
  3. Update paths dynamically if conflicts.  
- **Edge Cases**: Multiple forklifts at same position, blocked paths.

**Code Snippet (Java Example)**:  
```java
class Forklift {
    int id;
    int x, y; // Current position
    int destX, destY;
    List<int[]> path;
    public Forklift(int id, int x, int y, int destX, int destY) {
        this.id = id; this.x = x; this.y = y;
        this.destX = destX; this.destY = destY;
    }
}

class Warehouse {
    int[][] grid; // 0=free, 1=occupied
    List<Forklift> forklifts;
    void moveForklift(Forklift f) {
        // Implement Dijkstra’s for path, check collisions
    }
}
```

**Notes**:  
- Iteratively improved with interviewer guidance.  
- Tip: Practice system design with real-world constraints (e.g., traffic systems). Resources: GFG System Design.

**Interviewer**: OS specialist, focused on OS, DSA, design.

### Question 11: Paging, Page Table, Virtual Memory

**Problem Statement**:  
- Explain paging, page table, virtual memory, their need, max page table size, and virtual address space.

**Approach**:  
- **Paging**: Divides memory into fixed-size pages, maps virtual to physical addresses.  
- **Page Table**: Maps virtual page numbers to physical frames.  
- **Virtual Memory**: Abstracts physical memory, allows larger address space, isolation.  
- **Need**: Memory isolation, efficient allocation, multitasking.  
- **Max Page Table Size**:  
  - Entries = Virtual Address Space / Page Size.  
  - Example: 32-bit address, 4KB pages → 2^20 entries, size = entries * entry size (e.g., 4 bytes).  
- **Virtual Address Space**: 2^bits (e.g., 2^32 for 32-bit).  
- **Edge Cases**: Large page sizes, TLB misses.

**Notes**:  
- Answered with details.  
- Tip: Study memory management (GFG OS Notes).

### Question 12: Browsers, Threads vs. Processes, IPC

**Problem Statement**:  
- Compare browsers (e.g., Mozilla vs. Chrome) from OS perspective, explain Chrome’s cookie sharing, IPC, synchronization.

**Approach**:  
- **Browsers**:  
  - Mozilla: Multi-threaded, one process, fast but less isolated.  
  - Chrome: Multi-process (one per tab), isolated but memory-heavy.  
- **Cookie Sharing (Chrome)**:  
  - Uses IPC (e.g., shared memory, message passing) to sync cookies across processes.  
- **IPC**: Pipes, message queues, shared memory.  
- **Synchronization**: Mutexes, semaphores for shared resources.  
- **Example**: Chrome’s renderer processes communicate with browser process via IPC.

**Notes**:  
- Guided by interviewer, answered well.  
- Tip: Study browser architecture, IPC mechanisms (GFG OS).

### Question 13: Playlist Feature Design

**Problem Statement**:  
- Design a playlist feature with create, add, delete, shuffle, previous/next song functionalities. Specify data structures.

**Approach**:  
- **Data Structures**:  
  - Doubly Linked List: For previous/next navigation.  
  - Hash Map: For quick song lookup.  
  - Array: For shuffle (random index).  
- **Classes (Java)**:  
  - `Song`: ID, title, duration.  
  - `Playlist`: Manages songs, pointers for current/previous/next.  
- **Functionalities**:  
  - Create: Initialize empty list/map.  
  - Add: Insert to list, update map.  
  - Delete: Remove from list/map.  
  - Shuffle: Randomize array, rebuild list.  
  - Previous/Next: Use doubly linked list pointers.  
- **Edge Cases**: Empty playlist, single song, shuffle repeats.

**Code Snippet (Java Example)**:  
```java
class Song {
    String id, title;
    Song prev, next;
    public Song(String id, String title) { this.id = id; this.title = title; }
}

class Playlist {
    Song head, current;
    Map<String, Song> songMap;
    List<Song> shuffleList;
    public Playlist() {
        songMap = new HashMap<>();
        shuffleList = new ArrayList<>();
    }
    void addSong(String id, String title) {
        Song song = new Song(id, title);
        songMap.put(id, song);
        shuffleList.add(song);
        if (!head) head = current = song;
        else {
            song.prev = current;
            current.next = song;
            current = song;
        }
    }
    void deleteSong(String id) {
        Song song = songMap.get(id);
        if (!song) return;
        if (song.prev) song.prev.next = song.next;
        if (song.next) song.next.prev = song.prev;
        if (song == head) head = song.next;
        if (song == current) current = song.prev;
        songMap.remove(id);
        shuffleList.remove(song);
    }
    void shuffle() {
        Collections.shuffle(shuffleList);
        head = current = null;
        for (Song song : shuffleList) {
            addSong(song.id, song.title);
        }
    }
}
```

**Time Complexity**: O(1) for add/delete/next/previous, O(n) for shuffle.  
**Space Complexity**: O(n) for list/map.  
**Notes**:  
- Answered 80%; used doubly linked list.  
- Tip: Practice music player designs (GFG).

### Question 14: Football Game Design

**Problem Statement**:  
- Design a football game with classes (teams, players) and algorithms for passing, scoring.

**Approach**:  
- **Entities**:  
  - `Player`: Role (midfielder, defender), skills (speed, passing).  
  - `Team`: List of players, formation.  
  - `Game`: Manages teams, ball position.  
- **Classes (Java)**:  
  - `Player`: Attributes (position, skills), methods (move, pass).  
  - `Team`: Manages players, strategy.  
  - `Game`: Simulates match, tracks ball.  
- **Algorithms**:  
  - **Passing**: Model field as graph, players as nodes, edges weighted by distance/opponent strength. Use Dijkstra’s for optimal pass.  
  - **Scoring**: Evaluate shot feasibility based on player skill, distance to goal.  
- **Edge Cases**: Out-of-bounds, high opponent density.

**Code Snippet (Java Example)**:  
```java
class Player {
    String role;
    int x, y, passSkill;
    public Player(String role, int x, int y, int passSkill) {
        this.role = role; this.x = x; this.y = y; this.passSkill = passSkill;
    }
    boolean canPass(Player target, List<Player> opponents) {
        // Check feasibility based on skill, distance
        return true; // Placeholder
    }
}

class Game {
    List<Player> team1, team2;
    void passBall(Player from, Player to) {
        if (from.canPass(to, team2)) {
            // Update ball position
        }
    }
}
```

**Notes**:

- **AJAX**: Asynchronous JavaScript and XML, enables dynamic web updates.  
- **With NodeJS**:  
  - Frontend: Use `fetch` or `XMLHttpRequest` for async requests.  
  - Backend: NodeJS server with Express handles API endpoints.  
  - Example: Fetch stock data, update UI without reload.  
- **Implementation**: Set up `/api/data` endpoint, return JSON.

**Notes**:  
- Answered based on internship.  
- Tip: Study Express, async JavaScript. Resources: MDN, GFG.

### Question 19: Real-Time Stock Prices System

**Problem Statement**:  
- Design a system to display stock prices in real time, including frontend and backend.

**Approach**:  
- **Architecture**:  
  - **Frontend**: React for real-time UI updates.  
  - **Backend**: NodeJS with WebSockets (e.g., Socket.IO) or long polling.  
  - **Database**: MySQL for historical data, Redis for real-time cache.  
- **Approaches**:  
  - **Long Polling**: Client polls server periodically.  
  - **WebSockets**: Persistent connection, server pushes updates.  
- **Scalability**: Session reuse, load balancers, Redis pub/sub.  
- **Edge Cases**: High traffic, connection drops.

**Notes**:  
- Proposed WebSockets, impressed interviewer.  
- Tip: Practice real-time system design (GFG, System Design Primer).

### Question 21: Minimize X + Y (X = abcd, Y = a*b*c*d)

**Problem Statement**:  
- Find four-digit numbers X=abcd and Y=a*b*c*d such that X+Y is minimized.  
- **Example**: Find a,b,c,d (digits) to minimize abcd + (a*b*c*d).

**Approach**:  
- **Brute Force**: Try all a,b,c,d from 0-9 (O(10^4)).  
- **Optimal Approach**: Minimize Y (product) and X (concatenation).  
  - Pointwise:  
    1. Y is smallest when a,b,c,d are small (e.g., 1,1,1,1 → Y=1).  
    2. X=1111 for a=b=c=d=1.  
    3. Check constraints: Y must be 4-digit.  
    4. Try combinations: e.g., a=1, b=2, c=5, d=2 → Y=20, X=1252.  
    - Edge cases: Y not 4-digit, leading zeros.

**Code Snippet (C++)**:  
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

pair<int, int> minimizeSum() {
    int minSum = INT_MAX, bestX = 0, bestY = 0;
    for (int a = 1; a <= 9; a++) {
        for (int b = 0; b <= 9; b++) {
            for (int c = 0; c <= 9; c++) {
                for (int d = 0; d <= 9; d++) {
                    int X = a * 1000 + b * 100 + c * 10 + d;
                    int Y = a * b * c * d;
                    if (Y >= 1000 && Y <= 9999) {
                        if (X + Y < minSum) {
                            minSum = X + Y;
                            bestX = X;
                            bestY = Y;
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return {bestX, bestY};
}
```
