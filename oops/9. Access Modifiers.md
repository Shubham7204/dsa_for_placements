Access modifiers üîí are fundamental in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) üíª as they control the visibility üëÄ and accessibility of classes, methods, and variables in a program. They play a crucial role in encapsulation üîê by restricting or allowing access to certain parts of the code based on the specified modifier.

Access modifiers prevent data members or functions of one class from tampering üõë with another class while restricting its access. It allows us to select which members can be accessed directly by outside functions and which are not. ‚úÖ

## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure Overview
Before diving into the types of access modifiers üîí, let me walk you through the project structure that will be used to demonstrate their behavior.

**Project Structure**:
![](../pics/Pasted%20image%2020250622234252.png)
- **src/**:
  The root folder containing all the code files.

- **demoPackage/**:
  This package contains the `DemoClass`, which we will use to demonstrate the usage of different access modifiers in Java.

- **utilityClasses/**:
  This package contains the following classes:
  - `PublicClassExample`: Demonstrates the use of the `public` access modifier.
  - `PrivateClassExample`: Demonstrates the use of the `private` access modifier.
  - `ProtectedClassExample`: Demonstrates the use of the `protected` access modifier.
  - `DefaultClassExample`: Demonstrates the `default` (package-private) access modifier.

- **Main.java**:
  The main entry point for running the project.

This structure allows us to clearly show how access modifiers work across:
1. Classes within the same package (`demoPackage`).
2. Classes in different packages (`utilityClasses`).

Each of these access modifiers‚Äî`public`, `private`, `protected`, and `default`‚Äîwill be explored using these classes and their relationships.

## Types of Access Modifiers in Java
Java provides four main types of access modifiers:

### 1. Public
üåê **Scope**:
A `public` class, method, or variable is accessible from anywhere in the application, whether it‚Äôs within the same package or from a different package.

üõ†Ô∏è **Usage**:
The `public` modifier is used when you want the element (class, method, or variable) to be globally accessible. In the context of our project structure, the `PublicClassExample` in the `utilityClasses` package is accessible to other classes such as `DemoClass` in the `demoPackage` package.

üíª **Code Example: Demonstrating the Public Modifier**

**PublicClassExample.java**:
- Located in the `utilityClasses` package:

```java
package utilityClasses; // Declared in the utilityClasses package
public class PublicClassExample {
  public void display() {
    System.out.println("This is a public method in PublicClassExample.");
  }
}
````

**DemoClass.java**:

- Located in the `demoPackage` package, demonstrating the usage of the public method:

```java
package demoPackage; // Declared in the demoPackage package
import utilityClasses.PublicClassExample; // Importing the PublicClassExample from another package

public class DemoClass {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Creating an object of PublicClassExample
    PublicClassExample example = new PublicClassExample();

    // Calling the public method
    example.display(); // Accessible because 'display()' is public
  }
}
```
![](../pics/Pasted%20image%2020250622234330.png)
üß© **Explanation**:  
The `display()` method in `PublicClassExample` is declared as `public`, making it accessible across packages. By importing `utilityClasses.PublicClassExample` in `DemoClass`, we can use the method `display()` without any access restrictions.

When you run the `DemoClass`, the output will be:

```
This is a public method.
```

### 2. Private

üåê **Scope**:  
A `private` class, method, or variable is not accessible from anywhere in the application. It is only accessible within the same class and not from outside the class, whether in the same package, a child class, or a different package. It will be accessible only within the same class.

üõ†Ô∏è **Usage**:  
The `private` modifier is used when you want an element (class, method, or variable) to be accessible only within the same class. In the context of our project structure, the `PrivateClassExample` in the `utilityClasses` package is accessible to other classes because it is declared `public`. However, its methods won't be accessible to the `DemoClass` in the `demoPackage` package, as all the methods defined are `private`, which will result in a compile-time error.

üíª **Code Example: Demonstrating the Private Modifier**

**PrivateClassExample.java**:

- Located in the `utilityClasses` package

```java
package utilityClasses;

public class PrivateClassExample {
  private String secret = "Hidden Message";
  private void displaySecret() {
    System.out.println(secret);
  }
  private void show() {
    displaySecret(); // Accessible within the same class
  }
}
```
![](../pics/Pasted%20image%2020250622234350.png)
**DemoClass.java**:

- Located in the `demoPackage` package, demonstrating the usage of the private method

```java
package demoPackage;
import utilityClasses.PrivateClassExample;

public class DemoClass {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    PrivateClassExample example = new PrivateClassExample();
    example.show();
  }
}
```

The `show()` method in `PrivateClassExample` is declared as `private`, making it accessible only within the `PrivateClassExample` class. By importing `utilityClasses.PrivateClassExample` in `DemoClass`, we cannot use the `show()` method.

Whenever we try to access the `show()` method of the `PrivateClassExample`, since it's declared `private`, the compiler will give us a warning stating that `'show() has private access in utilityClasses.PrivateClassExample'`.

Even if you forcefully run the `DemoClass`, the output will be a compile-time error, which will be printed in the terminal:

```
java: show() has private access in utilityClasses.PrivateClassExample
```

### 3. Protected

üåê **Scope**:  
The `protected` modifier allows access to members within the same package and from subclasses in other packages. It offers more restricted access compared to `public`, but it is broader than `private`. By using `protected`, you enable controlled inheritance, allowing child classes to reuse and extend parent class functionality while keeping it hidden from unrelated classes.

üõ†Ô∏è **Usage**:  
The `protected` modifier is used in scenarios where inheritance is a key design pattern. For example, you might define reusable methods or fields in a superclass that should only be accessed or overridden by its subclasses. It is commonly used in frameworks or libraries to expose specific functionality to derived classes while restricting general access.

üíª **Code Example: Demonstrating the Protected Modifier**

**ProtectedClassExample.java**:

- Located in the `utilityClasses` package

```java
package utilityClasses;

public class ProtectedClassExample {
  protected void display() {
    System.out.println("Hello from Parent class!");
  }
}
```
![](../pics/Pasted%20image%2020250622234431.png)
**DemoClass.java**:

- Located in the `demoPackage` package, demonstrating the usage of the protected method:

```java
package demoPackage;
import utilityClasses.ProtectedClassExample;

public class DemoClass {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    ProtectedClassExample example = new ProtectedClassExample();
    example.display();
  }
}
```

The `display()` method in `ProtectedClassExample` is declared as `protected`, making it accessible only within the classes present in the same package and also in the classes present in different packages if they are a subclass of the `ProtectedClassExample`. By importing `utilityClasses.ProtectedClassExample` in `DemoClass`, we cannot use the `display()` method, as the `DemoClass` is not a subclass of the `ProtectedClassExample`.

Whenever we try to access the `display()` method of the `ProtectedClassExample`, since it's declared `protected`, the compiler will give us a warning stating that:

`'display()' has protected access in 'utilityClasses.ProtectedClassExample'`

In order to access the parent class method, we can make `DemoClass` extend the `ProtectedClassExample` class, thereby making `DemoClass` a subclass of `ProtectedClassExample`.

This will allow us to access the `display()` method of the `ProtectedClassExample`.

**Code**:

```java
package demoPackage;
import utilityClasses.ProtectedClassExample;

public class DemoClass extends ProtectedClassExample {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    ProtectedClassExample example = new ProtectedClassExample();
    example.display();
  }
}
```
![](../pics/Pasted%20image%2020250622234450.png)

The output in the Terminal will be:

```
Hello from Parent class!
```
![](../pics/Pasted%20image%2020250622234539.png)
### 4. Default (Package-Private)

üåê **Scope**:  
When no access modifier is specified, the `default` (package-private) access modifier is applied. Members with this access modifier are accessible only within the same package but not from outside it. This ensures that the functionality is available for closely related classes within the package while being hidden from other parts of the application.

üõ†Ô∏è **Usage**:  
Default access is used when you want to limit access to package-level components. It is ideal for internal helper classes, methods, or variables that do not need to be exposed to external packages. This access level supports modularity by grouping related classes and ensuring that their interactions remain encapsulated within the package.

üíª **Code Example: Demonstrating the Default Modifier**

**DefaultClassExample.java**:

- Located in the `utilityClasses` package:

```java
package utilityClasses;

public class DefaultClassExample {
  void display() {
    System.out.println("This is a default access method.");
  }
}
```
![](../pics/Pasted%20image%2020250622234546.png)
**DemoClass.java**:

- Located in the `demoPackage` package, demonstrating the usage of the default method:

```java
package demoPackage;
import utilityClasses.DefaultClassExample;

public class DemoClass {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    DefaultClassExample example = new DefaultClassExample();
    example.display();
  }
}
```

The `display()` method in `DefaultClassExample` is by default declared as `default` when no access modifier is assigned, making it accessible only within the classes present in the same package. By importing `utilityClasses.DefaultClassExample` in `DemoClass`, we cannot use the `display()` method, as the `DemoClass` is present in a different package, which is `demoPackage`.

Whenever we try to access the `display()` method of the `DefaultClassExample`, since it's declared `default`, the compiler will give us a warning stating that:

`'display()' is not public in 'utilityClasses.DefaultClassExample'. Cannot be accessed from outside package.`
![](../pics/Pasted%20image%2020250622234600.png)

Now, even if we try to run the file forcefully, it will give us a compile-time error in the terminal, stating:

```
java: display() is not public in utilityClasses.DefaultClassExample; cannot be accessed from outside package
```
![](../pics/Pasted%20image%2020250622234611.png)
Now that we have seen we cannot access the default access modifier methods in different packages, if we create a new class, let's say `Main`, in the same `utilityClasses` package, add the same code as we did in the `DemoClass` and try to access the `display()` method of the `DefaultClassExample`, it will not give us any compile-time warnings and will work absolutely fine.

The output in the Terminal will be:

```
This is a default access method.
```
