System design interviews can be intimidating.

How could you possibly design a large-scale system in just one hour, when real systems take years to evolve?

- The focus is on problem-solving, not delivering a perfect solution.
- The goal is to demonstrate your design skills, defend your choices, and respond constructively to feedback.

 

## What Is the Goal of a System Design Interview?

- It goes beyond evaluating technical design skills.
- It also evaluates collaboration, handling pressure, resolving ambiguity, and asking thoughtful questions.
- It helps identify red flags such as over-engineering, narrow thinking, or stubbornness.

 

## A Four-Step Process for Effective System Design Interviews

While every interview is unique, there are key steps that apply to almost all system design interviews.

 

### Step 1 – Understand the Problem and Establish Design Scope

Do not rush into solutions before fully understanding the problem.

Jumping to answers without clarifying requirements can be a red flag.

Ask questions to clarify requirements and assumptions instead of making guesses.

Engineers often want to tackle hard problems immediately, but that can lead to designing the wrong system.

When you receive answers (or when assumptions are required), write them down to keep track.

#### What Kind of Questions Should You Ask?

- What features need to be designed?
- How many users will the product support?
- What is the expected growth timeline (3, 6, 12 months)?
- What is the existing tech stack, and what services can be leveraged?

#### Example: Designing a News Feed

- **Candidate:** Is this for mobile, web, or both?
- **Interviewer:** Both.
- **Candidate:** What are the most important features?
- **Interviewer:** Ability to post and view friends’ feeds.
- **Candidate:** How is the feed sorted? Chronologically or by relevance?
- **Interviewer:** Assume it is chronological.
- **Candidate:** What is the maximum number of friends?
- **Interviewer:** 5,000.
- **Candidate:** What is the traffic volume?
- **Interviewer:** 10 million daily active users (DAU).
- **Candidate:** Can posts include media (images, videos)?
- **Interviewer:** Yes, including images and videos.

 

### Step 2 – Propose High-Level Design and Get Buy-In

In this step, collaborate with the interviewer to create a high-level system design.

- Sketch a blueprint and ask for feedback.
- Draw core components: clients, APIs, servers, databases, cache, CDN, message queues, etc.
- Perform quick calculations to check scalability. Confirm with the interviewer if this is needed.

Discuss use cases to refine the design and uncover edge cases.

Including API schema or database design depends on the problem scale. Clarify with the interviewer.

#### Example: News Feed

High-Level Features:

- Publishing – A user creates a post, which is stored and distributed to friends’ feeds.
- Feed Building – Aggregate friends’ posts in chronological order.

### Step 3 – Design Deep Dive

By this stage, you should have:

- Agreed on goals and features.
- Sketched a high-level blueprint.
- Received feedback on your design.
- Identified key components for deep dive.

Work with the interviewer to decide which components to explore in detail.

Possible focus areas:

- System performance characteristics.
- Critical design trade-offs.
- Detailed design of a system component.

Examples:

- URL Shortener – hashing strategy for generating short links.
- Chat System – minimizing latency and tracking online/offline status.

Manage your time. Do not dive into unnecessary details.

### Step 4 – Wrap-Up

At the end, the interviewer may ask follow-up questions or allow open discussion.

Suggestions:

- Identify bottlenecks and discuss improvements.
- Recap your design.
- Consider failure modes (e.g., server crashes, network issues).
- Discuss operational aspects (monitoring, alerting, rollouts).
- Consider scaling from 1M to 10M users.
- Propose refinements.

#### Do’s

- Ask for clarification instead of assuming.
- Understand requirements thoroughly.
- Recognize there is no single perfect answer.
- Share your thought process openly.
- Suggest multiple approaches when possible.
- Agree on the blueprint before detailing components.
- Treat the interviewer as a collaborator.

#### Don’ts

- Come unprepared for common design questions.
- Jump into solutions without understanding the problem.
- Spend too long on a single component early on.
- Be afraid to ask for hints if stuck.
- Think silently without communicating.

 

### Time Allocation for Each Step

A 45-minute interview is never enough to fully cover a design. Use your time wisely.

Suggested breakdown:

- Step 1 – Understand problem & scope: 3–10 min
- Step 2 – High-level design & buy-in: 10–15 min
- Step 3 – Design deep dive: 10–25 min
- Step 4 – Wrap-up: 3–5 min
